Coronavirus Coverage by State
=============================

A quick investigation into coronavirus coverage by state in the US. This pulls news data by state from 
[Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org) (using the US [geographic collections](https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/country-and-state)). 
It charts the percentage of media attention in each state being paid to the coronavirus pandemic over time.

## Setup

1. Setup Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks (no small task)
2. Create a `.env` file in this directory and put your Media cloud API key in like this: `MC_API_KEY=12344567890`

## Running

All the data from my version is committed here.
Just run throug the cells in the `corona-by-state` notebook to regenerate it all, and you'll end up with some pretty charts 📉👏🏾

I was inspired by this [tweet from Tyler Dukes](https://twitter.com/mtdukes/status/1270841633026826246) to compare the new coronavirus 
case rate and the media attention paid to the pandemic.
